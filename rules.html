              <h5>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND MANDATORY ARBITRATION</h5>
              <p>
                You and Operator agree that any dispute or claim arising out of, or relating in any way to, the Competition, your participation in it, these Rules, the  <a href="./termsofuse.html">Terms of Use </a>, or the <a href="./privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, including all issues concerning the construction, validity, interpretation, and enforceability of these Rules, <a href="./termsofuse.html">Terms of Use</a>, Entrant, Competitor, and/or Voter rights and obligations, the rights and obligations of Operator, or the extent of any waiver or release of claims by you, shall be settled by binding and unappealable arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association, by operation of these Rules, in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. ALL ARBITRATION CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER, OR OTHERWISE ON BEHALF OF OTHERS, IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator. The place of arbitration shall be Phoenix, Arizona, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, or is determined by the arbitrator that the arbitration proceed virtually (by videoconference). The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of Arizona. Each Party will, upon written request of the other Party, promptly provide the other with copies of all relevant documents. There shall be no other discovery allowed. Hearings will take place pursuant to the standard procedures of the Consumer Arbitration Rules, although the Parties can appear in person, by video, or telephonically. The standard provisions of the Consumer Arbitration Rules shall apply. The arbitrator will only have the authority to grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the Parties could have received in court, except injunctive relief. If either Party in a suit seeks injunctive relief, the arbitrator will complete arbitration of the dispute, issue an award of monetary compensation (if any), and then the party seeking injunctive relief may file a new action in state or federal court in Maricopa County, Arizona, solely for injunctive relief. The findings of fact and conclusions of law of the arbitrator shall not be submitted as evidence or constitute precedent in this subsequent suit. In addition, the prevailing Party will be entitled to recover its arbitration costs. Except as may be required by law, neither a Party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder, without the prior written consent of both Parties.
If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, then the remainder of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid or unenforceable provision were not contained herein.
